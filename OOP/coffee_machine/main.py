-= Explanation =-

Menu Class:

* The get_items() method is called to display the available drinks to the user (e.g., "latte/espresso/cappuccino").
* The find_drink(order_name) method is used to find a specific drink the user wants to order.

CoffeeMaker Class:

* The report() method is used to display the current status of the machineâ€™s resources (e.g., water, milk, coffee).
* The is_resource_sufficient(drink) method checks if there are enough resources to make the selected drink.
* The make_coffee(order) method deducts the resources and makes the coffee if the payment is successful.

MoneyMachine Class:

* The report() method displays the current profit.
* The make_payment(cost) method asks the user to insert coins and checks if the payment is sufficient.

How It Works:

* The machine will keep running, displaying the menu options and waiting for the user to make a selection (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
* If the user types "report", it will show the current resources and total money earned.
* If the user types "off", the machine will shut down.
* If the user selects a valid drink, the program checks if the resources are sufficient and processes the payment before making the drink.
